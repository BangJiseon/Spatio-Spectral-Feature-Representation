# Spatio-Spectral Feature Representation for Motor Imagery Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Modules
 We provide Matlab and Python implementation for generating feature representation and classification.

'Filterset_OpenBMI.m' : codes for generating filter-set. 

'FeatureRepresentation_OpenBMI.m' : codes for generating feature representation.

'Classification_OpenBMI.py' : codes for classification.

'func_mutual_information2.m', 'prep_filterbank2.m' : The following two files are slightly modified from the original toolbox.
