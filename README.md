# Spatio-Spectral Feature Representation for Motor Imagery Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Modules
 We provide Matlab and Python implementation for generating feature representation and classification.

 Belows are the description of each file.
 

'Filterset_OpenBMI.m' : Code for generating filter-set. 

'FeatureRepresentation_OpenBMI.m' : Code for generating feature representation.

'Classification_OpenBMI.py' : Code for classification.

'func_mutual_information2.m', 'prep_filterbank2.m' : The following two files are slightly modified versions from the original toolbox.

'electrode_position.mat' : Data indicating the location of channels. Used for local average reference function.

## Requirements
Matlab R2017a or later

Python 3 (Tensorflow==1.15.0)
